# Open Raadsinformatie API docs

Open Raadsinformatie (ORI) aims to make governmental decision making more transparent
by aggregating and standardizing meeting & decision data.
Currently, the API includes data from more than 110 municipalities (gemeenten) and 5 provinces.

## Endpoints

The ORI API has several endpoints for different goals:

- the **REST API** for fetching individual resources
- an **Elastic** endpoint for full-text search

### REST API

Endpoint: [`https://id.openraadsinformatie.nl`](https://id.openraadsinformatie.nl)

The ORI REST API is hofsted at the `id.openraadsinformatie.nl` subdomain.
Use this to get individual meetings / motions / agenda items / persons / etc, such as [`https://id.openraadsinformatie.nl/243815`](https://id.openraadsinformatie.nl/243815).
It is by far the most performant API for ORI, as it stores the various representations (TTL, RDF/XML, N3, N-Triples, JSON-LD) as static files.
Since this API serves RDF, it might be a good idea to [get familiar with linked data](https://ontola.io/what-is-linked-data/).

There is a special endpoint for getting all organizations: [`https://api.openraadsinformatie.nl/v1/organizations`](https://api.openraadsinformatie.nl/v1/organizations)

Read more about the REST API in its [github repo](https://github.com/ontola/ori_api) and its [documentation](https://id.openraadsinformatie.nl/).

If you want to see some examples of how to query this endpoint, check out [`example_requests.http`](/example_requests.http).

### Elastic

Endpoint: `https://api.openraadsinformatie.nl/v1/elastic/`

This is an ElasticSearch endpoint.
Elastic has powerful full-text search capabilities.

The repo for this API can be found [here](https://github.com/openstate/open-raadsinformatie).
Read the [Elastic v7.0](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.0/index.html) docs for more information.
Only specific Elastic features (endpoints) are publicly available.
This is to prevent (malicious or accidental) write / remove commands.

If you want to see some examples of how to query this endpoint, check out [`example_requests.http`](/example_requests.http).

## Changes from V0

The previous API version, V0, was available at `https://api.openraadsinformatie.nl/v1/`.
These things are different in V1 from V0:

- ElasticSearch was upgraded from 5 to 7 ([upgrade guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-upgrading-v7.html))
- Events are now split between "Meetings" and "AgendaItems"
- The new REST API for performant Linked Data resource fetching
- Documents are no longer nested under Events
- PDF documents are cached, so now it's possible to query from sources that had no support for this (such as iBabs)
- An `@context` json object was added in ElasticSearch for [RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) / [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org) compliance.
- A `discussed_at` field is added to AgendaItems and Documents.
- The available keys in the resources still adhere to Popolo where possible, so they have not changed.
- Text of extracted documents is now paginated, it's an array of pages.

## FAQ

## How is your data standardized?

Most of our data follows the international [Popolo](https://www.popoloproject.com) specification.
We've added a couple of concepts, such as AgendaItems, which are namespaced under the Meeting ontology.
This Meeting ontology is a [work in progress](https://github.com/openstate/open-raadsinformatie/issues/127).

In the future, we hope to use the [VNG Open Raadsinformatie spec](https://github.com/VNG-Realisatie/Open-Raadsinformatie/) for serialization.

### Who's behind this project?

ORI was initiated by the [Open State Foundation](https://openstate.eu).
[VNG Realisatie](https://www.vngrealisatie.nl/producten/pilots-open-raadsinformatie) is the main funder.
[Ontola](https://ontola.io) / [Argu](https://argu.co) is responsible for the technology.
